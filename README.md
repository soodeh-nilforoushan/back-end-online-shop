This is an end-to-end back-end project where I designed and implemented RESTful APIs within a clean architecture framework. The project includes two main entities: User and Store.

User Features:

Users can log in, log out, and sign up.
Users can add items to their baskets and remove items from them.
Users can finalize their purchases.

Admin Features:

Admins have different permissions and can manage the data repository.
Admins can remove items, update product information, or add/delete products as needed.

Example of Implemented APIs:
/api/v1/authentication/users
/api/v1/users/me/permissions
